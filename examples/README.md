# Azure Virtual Network Hub Terraform Module

This module deploys a spoke network using the [Microsoft recommended Hub-Spoke network topology](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke). Usually, only one hub in each region with multiple spokes and each of them can also be in separate subscriptions.

If you are deploying the spoke VNet in the same Hub Network subscription, then make sure you have set the argument `is_spoke_deployed_to_same_hub_subscription = true`. This helps the module manage the network watcher, flow logs and traffic analytics for all the subnets in the Virtual Network. If you are deploying the spoke VNet's in separate subscriptions, set this argument to `false`.

This is designed to quickly deploy hub and spoke architecture in the azure and further security hardening would be recommend to add appropriate NSG rules to use this for any production workloads.

## Module Usage

``` hcl
module "vnet-spoke" {
  source = "github.com/tietoevry-infra-as-code/terraform-azurerm-caf-vnet-spoke?ref=v1.0.0"

  # By default, this module will create a resource group, proivde the name here
  # to use an existing resource group, specify the existing resource group name,
  # and set the argument to `create_resource_group = false`. Location will be same as existing RG.
  # RG name must follow Azure naming convention. ex.: rg-<App or project name>-<Subscription type>-<Region>-<###>
  # Resource group is named like this: rg-spoke-tieto-internal-prod-westeurope-001
  resource_group_name = "rg-spoke-tieto-internal-shared-westeurope-001"
  location            = "westeurope"
  # Specify if you are deploying the spoke VNet using the same hub subscription
  is_spoke_deployed_to_same_hub_subscription = false

  # Provide valid VNet Address space for spoke virtual network.  
  vnet_address_space = ["10.2.0.0/16"]

  # Adding Standard DDoS Plan, and custom DNS servers (Optional)
  dns_servers = []

  # (Required) Project_Name, Subscription_type and environment are must to create resource names.

  # Multiple Subnets, Service delegation, Service Endpoints, Network security groups

  # Adding TAG's to your Azure resources (Required)

## Terraform Usage

To run this example you need to execute following Terraform commands

``` hcl
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
